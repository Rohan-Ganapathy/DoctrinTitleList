This is wrapped around with by a library and framework build in java and maven to make writing tests, building and integrating with CI/CD systems easy. Cucumber-TestNG frameworks are also used. Cucumber makes test cases easy to maintain, create, read and understand to non-technical users while testNG is used to run the cucumber feature file and also makes it easy to integrate and scale with other systems.
